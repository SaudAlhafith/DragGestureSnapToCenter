# DragGestureSnapToCenter
### This project shows how SnapToGrid feature in apps like instagram works

The technique is my idea, not the real technique used in such apps.
But it works as it should be.

The idea is : when the user are moving an object, and he got close to the center, a counter starts.
while he is close to the center, if 2 seconds passes the snap happens
